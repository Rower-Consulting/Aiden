# Aiden - The AI Admin ü§ñ
This project is a showcase for "taming complexity" using *adaptive* machine learning. It is an adaptation (and abstraction) of a real-world use case from our portfolio. In full, it demonstrates our view of how analytic and operational systems are melding various working models as "AI" continues to proliferate in the marketplace of ideas.

Everyone *talks* about AI, but Rower is putting forward a working example of what we view as a cohesive new class of software. These applications forge-weld together what previously was thought of as the distinct domains of "analytics" and "operational" systems into a new form centered on intelligent tooling and human-centered design.

## Summary üì∞
"Aiden" is a focused proof-of-concept - a structured set of algorithms that performs analysis of network telemetry that assists a systems admin in a mission-critical role. It reviews an enriched 'funnel' of suspicious open-web traffic and discovers threat-actor patterns. With its ability to analyze data "in flight" it is able to rapidly offer responses that prompt the human operator to review findings and confirm the mitigation strategy. 

## Technology üìê
Even though this only a proof of concept, we plan to show how we build and deploy a full multi-targeting codebase using .NET technologies. We employ the [Avalonia](https://avaloniaui.net/) framework to deploy versions of these applications to desktop, mobile and web. And *under the hood* it also leverages a blend of well-established tools intertwined with some of the most recent developments in AI and machine learning. The key underlying technology we're using for "Aiden" is Microsoft's [Semantic Kernel](https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel), which can be thought of as an orchestrator for large language models - but can also serve to connect a wide variety of tools such as optimized search, process planning and other classes of custom code. 

Aside from our current focus in .NET, it should be noted that Semantic Kernel *also* has support for python and java. More can be learned in the documentation [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/overview/). 

All of the tools in this project are open-source.  Rower holds that the transparency and collaboration inherent to open-source initiatives fosters trustworthiness in both product and process. Through our leveraging of, contributing to and supporting open-source tools, we maintain our commitment to building robust, reliable and sustainable systems with our clients.
