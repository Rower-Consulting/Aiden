# Aiden - The AI Admin ðŸ¤–
This project is a showcase for "taming complexity" using *adaptive* machine learning. It is an abstraction of a real-world use case from our portfolio that runs in a controlled environment.

Everyone *talks* about AI, but Rower is putting forward a working example of what we see emerging as a new class of software. "AI" is only <u>one</u> piece of a broader mosaic of elements that must be forge-welded together into a cohesive solution. These new hybrid applications must bring together what previously was thought of as the distinct domains of "analytics" and "operational" systems. They intertwine advanced intelligent tools with [human-centered design (HCD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human-centered_design). In full, it underscores our view of how analytic and operational systems can *no longer afford to remain separate* without significant adverse cost to an organization. <u>These are the new <i>table stakes</i></u> of operating a business in today's technology landscape. 

## The Scenario ðŸ“°
"Aiden" is a narrowly scoped proof-of-concept. At its heart it is a flexible set of algorithms that perform analyses of network telemetry. The use case is to support a systems administrator in a mission-critical role of monitoring open web traffic as it arrives at client web server endpoints. It reviews an enriched 'funnel' of suspect traffic and attempts to uncover threat-actor patterns. With Aiden's ability to analyze data "in flight" it can rapidly offer responses that prompt the operator to review findings and confirm/enact the mitigation strategy from the same user interface. Both the *analysis* and *operational tasks* are performed in the same app with interactive tooling that prompts the user to action and provides feedback on the results of those actions.
